            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>Here are some wireframes designed by professionals. Each of them uses at least one rule of effective design in order to visually communicate with clients.</p>

              <p>
                <strong>Designed by Christos. Image from Dribbble.com. </strong>This is an example of a high-fidelity wireframe for a tech company website. It uses a few simple graphics and one spot color with different transparency levels. The dark purple call-to-action button employs the Gestalt principle of Focal Point, and the three features on the second section employ the Gestalt principle of Grouping. The designer also makes use of multiple font weights to show hierarchy. This is a great example of a monochromatic color scheme, clear-cut user interface and straightforward communication to clients. From the color scheme and simplistic design choices, we can guess that the intended users are of working age, perhaps in the business field.

                <p>
                  <strong>Designed by JT Grauke for Focus Lab. Image from Dribbble.com. </strong>This is an example of a mid-fidelity wireframe with a minimalist design. A call-to-action button on the landing page prompts the user to learn more. You can see a clear hierarchy in the page headings. In addition to the principles of Grouping and Proximity, a figure-ground relationship is also established with the square in the foreground overlapping the curved shape in the background. One noteworthy design choice here is the menu, which is an expandable button in the left corner of the landing page. This helps reduce visual clutter. Thus we can infer that the client’s service is intended for an older audience.

                <p>
                  <strong>Designed by Lucian Ciocea. Image from Behance.net. </strong>This is an example of a mid-fidelity wireframe. It’s grid-based layout shows strong visual organization, and the designer’s choice of using multiple shades of gray conveys elegance. Overall, the design evokes emotions of relaxation and serenity, setting the stage for a peaceful user experience. It feels as if it were intended for a spa or salon for older users who face stress regularly.

              <p>
                <strong>Designed by Pixsellz. Image from Dribbble.com. </strong>This is an example of a low-fidelity wireframe using grayscale and one spot color. You can see multiple calls to action indicated by the prominent color, and clear visual hierarchy in the line weights and darkness. The repetition of elements makes it a familiar and therefore comfortable user experience. The numbers and charts imply that it is intended for an adult audience, perhaps even for those with a technical background. You might see such a wireframe being made for a company that does a lot of data analysis.

            <p>
              <strong>Designed by Filip Resse. Image from Resse’s blog on 99designs.com. </strong>This is an example of a low-fidelity wireframe hand-drawn on paper. As most paper drawings, this wireframe is not to scale, but still shows a clear visual grid. The designer’s use of shading establishes a figure-ground relationship between the grid elements and the page background. This looks like it might be intended for a user dashboard or a web application interface.

              <strong>Designed by Karol Woźniak for Vooom. Image from Dribbble.com. </strong><p>The clean and elegant design, coupled with the efficient use of white space, characterizes this mid-fidelity wireframe. The designer’s use of shadow makes elements on the page stand out. Additionally, the graphics are universal and therefore can be understood by a wide audience. From these, we can guess that the company specializes in transportation or ride sharing services.</p>
